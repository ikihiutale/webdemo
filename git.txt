# Push a branch and automatically set tracking
# Tracking is essentially a link between a local and remote branch. 
# When working on a local branch that tracks some other branch, you can 
# git pull and git push without any extra arguments and git will know what to do.
#
# Pushes the "master" branch to "origin" remote and sets up tracking
git push -u origin master

# However, git push will by default push all branches that have the same name 
# on the remote. To limit this behavior to just the current branch, set this configuration option:
git config --global push.default tracking

# This is to prevent accidental pushes to branches which you’re not ready to push yet

# Pull with rebase instead of merge
$ git pull --rebase
# e.g. if on branch "master": performs a git fetch origin,
# then git rebase origin/master

# git fetch
# git diff ...origin
# git diff ...origin is equivalent to git diff $(git-merge-base HEAD origin) origin

# STAGE:
git add -A # stages All
git add . # stages new and modified, without deleted
git add -u # stages modified and deleted, without new
